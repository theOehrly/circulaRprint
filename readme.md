#**circulaRprint**

**What is circularprint?**  
CirculaRprint is a controller software for circular plotters.
The plotter hardware consists of a rotating table and of arm that moves across it in and arc. 
This eliminates the need for linear bearings/rods on the two main axis.
The tool tip (i.e. a pen, laser, whatever...) needs to be exactly centered above the table or else there will be a 
dead spot in the middle of the table that can't be reached.
A disadvantage of this approach is the inconsistent resolution, as it gets lower the further you get away from the 
table center (only applies to the table axis, not the arm).

Here are some images that should give you a basic understanding of how the plotter works.

**Hardware**  
A Raspberry Pi is used as a controller board.  
Also a few H-Bridge motor drivers are needed.  
Of course some stepper motors (I took mine from old DVD drives and printers) and a few more components to build the rest from.
