Changelog of RPrint
###############

v0.0.7:
- added source/provider chain:
    every class requests single PathSegments from its "provider"-class
    PathPlanner requests GCommands from a source and creates PathSegments from that
    serve_next() is a required function for all classes in the calculation chain
    advantages: Not everything needs to be precalculated
                Possibility of modular calculation chain
- added SegmentBuffers and the ability to use simultaneous thread calculation or pre-calculation
- removed accelerate_b_light in StepAP

v0.0.6:
- added Z axis movement
- added always unhold option

v0.0.5:
- correction of motor direction is now done in BipolarStepperMotor class
- huge improvments to SegmentAccelerationPlanner speed; now only takes 20%-30% of calculation time compared to v0.0.4
- improvements to minimum step delay in BipolarStepperMotorClass; now based on Motor max speed
- added distortion correction option in config
- fixed bug in SegmentAccelerationPlanner that cause unnecessary deceleration and acceleration
- code cleanup and improved naming conventions
- fixed showgcode option in debugout

v0.0.4:
- various changes to the GCommand and PathSegment data structure
- fixed issues with the calculation of the difference between old and new alpha values
    (this lead to the table turning in the wrong direction)
- added possibility to cancel print by using ctrl+c
- added Grbl inspired acceleration control featuring overall and per axis speed and acceleration limits
- added backlash correction

v0.0.3:
- replaced Flow data handling
- added disclaimer for debug out
- fixed no circle drawn if circle starts at origin
- improved code style in PathPlanner
- fixed calculation of gamma
- fixed no circle drawn if circle center is the same as table center

v0.0.2:
- made linear interpolation work
- switching PathPlanner linear calculations to vectors
- added config file
- added gcode parser + possibility of reading gcode from file
- introducing Flow for data processing
- added graphical DEBUG (only) output
- added arc interpolation (G02/G03) !!circle segments may be 180 degrees at maximum

v0.0.1:
 ++ first test ++
